Configure
Input: ./WTF configure 127.0.0.1 50000
Expected Output: 
.Configure file created with “127.0.0.1\n50000”
Currentversion
Input: ./WTF currentversion newProject
Expected Output: 
Prints out filename of file in project along with version number
Ex.
Filename: file1.txt
Version: 0
Create
Input: ./WTF create newProject
Expected: Success message and a newProject folder inside ./clientDir and ./serverDir
Input: ./WTF create newProject (again to test error handling)
Expected: Error message (project already exists) from both server and client
Destroy
Input: ./WTF destroy newProject 
Expected: Success message and destroys newProject only on server
Input: ./WTF destroy newProject (again to test error handling)
Expected Output: Error message (project does not exist)
Add
Input: ./WTF add newProject file1.txt
Expected Output: Success message and new entry in client’s .Manifest (entry format is [code] [filename] [file version] [hash])
Input: ./WTF add newProject file1.txt (again)
Expected Output: Message - File has already been added and no no new changes have been made
Input: ./WTF add newProject file1.txt (again, but after changing file1.txt content)
Expected Output: Success message and file1.txt’s entry code is changed from A to M (denoting modification)
Input: ./WTF add newProject nonexistent.txt 
Expected Output: Error message - File does not exist
Input: ./WTF add nonexistentProject file1.txt
Expected Output: Error Message - Project does not exist
Remove
Input: ./WTF remove newProject nonexistent.txt
Expected Output: Error Message - File does not exist
Input: ./WTF remove nonexistentProject file1.txt
Expected Output: Error Message - Project does not exist
Input: ./WTF remove newProject file1.txt
Expected Output: Success message and file1.txt’s entry code is changed to a D (denoting a delete)
Input: ./WTF remove newProject file1.txt (again)
Expected Output: Success message and file1.txt’s entry stays the same
Commit
Input: ./WTF commit newProject (with nonempty .Update)
Expected Output: Error Message due to nonempty .update
Input: ./WTF commit newProject (with .Conflict)
Expected Output: Error Message due to .conflict existing
Input: ./WTF commit newProject (with no .Conflict and empty .Update)
Expected Output: Success message
creates .Commit with all file entries that are changed (file entries with code M,A,D)
Every file entry in .Commit that was modified now has a modified hash (different from hash in .Manifest) and an incremented version number 
For each file entry in .Commit, its code and file name is printed
Ex. (D file1.txt)
Server gives client a client_id and stores this id along with commit in a LL that holds all pending commits.
Input: ./WTF commit newProject (client and server .Manifest versions don’t match)
Expected Output: Error message
Input: ./WTF commit newProject (again, with versions matching)
Expected Output: Same as before
Input: ./WTF commit project (nonexistent project)
Expected Output: Error - project name doesn’t exist on client 
Input: ./WTF commit newProject (right after pushing)
Expected Output: Message - Nothing to commit
Push
Input: ./WTF push newProject (with .Commit file that has entries)
Expected: Success message
Deletes .Commit file
Client .Manifest updates
The version number is incremented
All file entries that were in .Commit now have a T code (denoting tracked) 
Files that were modified now have their modified hash 
Previously tracked files in the .Manifest before committing and pushing are still there
Server .Manifest looks exactly the same as client .Manifest
Server’s newProject looks exactly like client’s
Input: ./WTF push newProject (again, consecutively)
Expected Output: Error message, no commit file 
 
Update
Input: ./WTF update newProject (client’s .Manifest is empty and server’s .Manifest has a file)
Expected Output: Success Message
Prints out “A [filepath]”
Creates .Update file
.Update file has an entry (A [filepath] [hash of file])
Input: ./WTF update newProject (testing conflict: client has a file that is different from server’s file and has modified it)
Expected Output: Conflict Message
Prints out all [code] [filepath] like normal
Creates .Conflict with conflicted file entry
Upgrade
Input: ./WTF upgrade newProject
Expected Output: Success message
Updated .Manifest (client’s .Manifest looks exactly like server’s)
Client’s project directory looks exactly like server’s
Currentversion
Input: ./WTF currentversion newProject
Expected Output: Prints out all files and their version numbers
Ex: Filename is: file1.txt \n Version is: 1 \n Filename is: file2.txt \n Version is: 0 \n (and so on…)
Checkout
Input: ./WTF checkout newProject (exists on server dir)
Expected Output: Success Message
newProject is cloned from server to client 
History
Input ./WTF history newProject
Expected Output: Success Message
print .History to STDOUT (.History separates successful commits to project with projectversion and newline)
0
A file1 0 hash
1
M file1 1 hash
A file2 0 hash
Rollback
Input: ./WTF rollback newProject 0 (after 1 successful push)
Expected: Success message
newProject directory is reverted back to version 0 for manifest and file contents. Backup folder should be empty at this point.
