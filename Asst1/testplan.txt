Test cases:

Build
Blank file: writes to a blank HuffmanCodebook with just the escape sequence and newline char
“a dog and a cat and dog ran.” HuffmanCodebook included “ran.” as a token, duplicate a’s and and’s were accounted for. 
Text file containing all integers from 1-100000 separated by newline: HuffmanCodebook creates a code for every integer as intended. Runtime: 3.482s clock time, 1.095s system
Tested a file containing 10000 randomly generated strings with duplicates, separated by newlines: Runtime: 0.232s clock time, 0.158s system
Recursive build:
Tested having two text files in current directory
Two text files, one in a subdirectory
Nested subdirectories and multiple text files spaced in each

Compress:
Made test codebooks for files with multiple words and delimiters
Checked that each compressed file generated holds expected bitstring
Recursive compress:
For each codebook made, I tested multiple files in 3 different levels of directories
Checked that each compressed file generated holds expected bitstring

Decompress
After testing compress, I would compress all my test files, and decompress them to see it matches the original uncompressed file

Recursive decompress:
Same process as recursive compress
