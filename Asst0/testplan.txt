In order to test our code, we created separate main functions in our separate c files before merging them into fileSort.c.

For comparator.c:
    Divided into two comparators, string and integer. Returns -1, 0, 1.
    For string:
        Tested for lexicographical order (with two strings a and b):
        1. where a < b, i.e. a comes before b in the dictionary. a = apples, b = car. RETURNS -1
        2. where a == b, i.e. a is the same string as b. a = car, b = car. RETURNS 0
        3. where a > b, i.e. a comes after b in the dictionary. a = car, b = apples. RETURNS 1
        4. where only a is empty string. RETURNS -1
        5. where only b is empty string. RETURNS 1
        5. where both a or b are empty strings. RETURNS 0
    For integers:
        converted values based on atoi, then compared new values.
        empty strings converted to 0's.
        1. where a < b. a = 500, b = 1000. RETURNS -1
        2. where a == b. a = 1, b = 1. RETURNS 0
        3. where a > b. a = 500, b = 1. RETURNS 1

For sort.c:
    created two different linked lists that held either all integers or all characters.
    Both insertion sort and quicksort returned the same strings. When timing them using "time", 
    quicksort was faster. As expected.
    1->3->4->2->0 ===> RETURNS 0->1->2->3->4
    hi->there->every->one ===> RETURNS every->hi->one->there
    Tested for duplicates: 1->3->4->2->0->0 RETURNS 0->0->1->2->3->4
    hi->hi->a->c RETURNS a->c->hi->hi


For readFile.c and fileSort.c:
    before merging comparator and sort, we wanted to print out if the file was properly tokenized and the 
    linked list was added to accordingly. 
    Then after merging sort and comparator, we ran edge cases to see if empty strings were handled accordingly,
    as well as empty files and whitespaces, and negative numbers.
    Also tested for all fatal errors.
    5,   4, 3, 1, 1 RETURNS 1\n1\n3\n4\n5
           ,3,       4,	,	RETURNS 0\n0\n3\n4
    -5, -2, 1, 3   ,     -5 RETURNS   -5\n-5\n-2\n1\n3
    ,   hi,    there,  			everyone RETURNS hi\nthere\neveryone
    hi,,hi RETURNS \nhi\nhi
    (empty file) RETURNS Warning: File "empty.txt" is empty!
    ./fileSort -t empty.txt RETURNS Fatal Error: "-t" is not a valid sort flag
